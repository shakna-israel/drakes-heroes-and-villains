<p>Suzie blinked in pain, light glaring in her face, but before her eyes could adjust, or she could really start thinking properly, a fist slammed into her face, snapping her neck back and she swore violently, "Fuck!"</p>
<p>Then another fist slammed into her gut, and she heard something blurry being yelled at her.</p>
<p>She blinked, trying to focus, she needed to… Think…?</p>
<p>A fist break her nose.</p>
<p>She blinked, dizzy, trying to understand the words being shouted at her, but she just couldn't.</p>
<p>Then the black closed in around her vision again.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<hr />
<p>Andrew ducked back down, and cocked his weapon, glancing over at his partner, Alison. "Is that seriously a building full of armed people? In the middle of Melbourne?"</p>
<p>She smiled softly and shrugged, "Its nutters. But what else would you expect, Drakes is involved."</p>
<p>Andrew laughed, "Yeah… Things really do go crazy around her, don't they?"</p>
<p>Alison checked her weapon and turned around, sighting through her scope, "Well, she's good at what she does. What else would you expect?"</p>
<p>He nodded and turned, sighting through his own rifle, "Yeah… Team 2 in position?"</p>
<p>A voice crackled in his ear, "Yes, sir. Seven on the second floor, six visible on the bottom."</p>
<p>Alison smiled, "I've got three on the third floor."</p>
<p>Andrew breathed in slowly, "Take them out."</p>
<p>The gun bucked in his hands, and he resighted, firing again as fear began to appear in his targets.</p>
<p>The gun stopped moving, smoke rising from the end of the barrel, and he flicked it over his shoulder, "Team 2?"</p>
<p>"All down, sir."</p>
<p>He grabbed the anchored rope nearby and slid down to the ground, drawing his gun again as he hit the gravel, and he ran up to the edge of the building, ducking beside the door as Alison sighted and blasted it open with her rifle, covering him.</p>
<p>He stepped inside, firing at a wounded man before he could grasp his weapon and began moving upstairs, "All down on first."</p>
<p>He fired twice as he entered the room, two militants collapsing, a third throwing his hands into the air, "Jesus! We surrender!"</p>
<p>Andrew glared at him, "What are the documents in front of you?"</p>
<p>"We're just mercs!" The man yelled with an Australian accent, "We were just paid to kidnap a girl. They gave us a plan, and some guns."</p>
<p>Andrew frowned, "You were paid to kidnap Susan Drakes?"</p>
<p>"Susan Jameson." The guy said nervously, holding his hands high, and Andrew shook his head, "She's an ASIO agent, you idiot. Who paid you?"</p>
<p>"I just have a name." The man said nervously, reaching down slowly and turning a piece of paper to face Andrew, he pushed it to his side of the table and stepped back against the wall.</p>
<p>Andrew walked up and glanced down, "Aw, shit."</p>
<hr />
<p>Captain J leaned back from his rifle and swallowed, "That was an impressive attack. Those guys are good."</p>
<p>Dunstan looked at his captain, "Sir? Really?"</p>
<p>Captain J nodded and looked back down his scope, "Nineteen targets, four man team. They eradicated them in about seven seconds. Their captain is a sniper, like me… In fact, if I wasn't so sure of myself, I'd say he would be the better sniper."</p>
<p>Dunstan rolled his eyes, "A team of snipers, sir? I can just blow 'em up when we need to."</p>
<p>The captain glared back at his explosives expert, "Do it, and I'll be the one to kill you. Scratch that, I'll get Sam to skin you alive. They have information. For now… We watch. Got it?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir."</p>
<p>The captain smiled and glanced over at Kaley, who was busy glaring at a computer screen strapped to her wrist, "You got anything, girl?"</p>
<p>She glared over at him, "No. Drakes is a real bitch."</p>
<p>Kaley went back to glaring at the screen and he sighed, "How so?"</p>
<p>"The GPS I found rigged to her house targeted me when I tripped the wrong thing, and launched a drone. Barely shut down the flying blur of blades. I only could because I used one of her own programming techniques. That's annoying."</p>
<p>His eyes widened, "We almost had a drone rip us to shreds? And you said nothing?"</p>
<p>"I was busy shutting it down." She said with a shrug, "Oh, damn it… My computer just wiped its own memory."</p>
<p>He shook his head, "Maybe breaking into ASIO's database would be easier."</p>
<p>"I had… Now I have to again, once I get this piece of crap working." Kaley growled.</p>
