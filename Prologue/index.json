This room was simply clinical, a reflection of its master.</p>\n<p>The auditor took the glasses from his nose and rubbed them gently with a folded cloth that appeared from a pocket, before being refolded and placed away as efficiently as they had come.</p>\n<p>\"I shall ask you again, Miss Drakes. In the time that you spent with John O'Connor, would you have ever expected him to act the way he did in Canada?\"</p>\n<p>She glared at the man, feeling her patience reach cracking point, \"It's been three damn years. Three years since I saved what could be saved, and returned home. Three years since I had my last interview. I am not part of this organisation, and I have nothing to do with it anymore. I am not an agent, and I do not care about politics.\"</p>\n<p>The man frowned, \"That was not what I asked.\"</p>\n<p>She laughed, and glared at him, \"I don't give a shit what you think. In no way do I care. I've paid the price for my loyalty.\"</p>\n<p>He grimaced and adjusted his glasses, \"Miss Drakes, I must ask you to cooperate. We are just trying to ascertain the facts. Investigations are being run, around the world, to prevent this from ever happening again.\"</p>\n<p>She glared at him, \"Let it. I do not care. I was a teenager when ASIO employed me. I'd fixed my arm with an exoskeleton, something quicker and smarter than anyone else had made. So you employed me. Made me a bodyguard for a senator, right on the eve of a dozen assassination attempts. I was kidnapped by Josiah McIntyre, arguably the only man who could ever match my intellect. Then I was deployed to Canada, and attacked by my trainer and mentor, and damn nearly killed. I was forced to kill. So... You know what, I think I've done enough.\"</p>\n<p>The man sighed, \"I am simply asking questions.\"</p>\n<p>Her blue eyes blazed with anger as she leaned forward in the seat, her mechanical arm hissing from inside, \"I am simply refusing to answer.\"</p>\n<p>The man stood slowly, \"Answering the questions would be easier.\"</p>\n<p>She glared, \"Easier than what?\"</p>\n<p>\"I would be forced to arrest you, and continue this pleasant conversation as an interrogation. One that will not end til we have the answers we seek.\"</p>\n<p>She laughed at him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ted rubbed his brown mess of hair, sitting up with a groan. What woke him?</p>\n<p>He blinked, trying to think, when he heard a dull, nearby rumble. He fumbled around and picked up the phone, \"Yes?\"</p>\n<p>The person on the other side appeared surprised that they had woken him, \"Sir, I'm afraid I need your full attention.\"</p>\n<p>Ted winced, \"Crap. What's happened?</p>\n<p>\"I am calling from Sydney, sir. Your wife came here for a meeting?\"</p>\n<p>He groaned, \"ASIO, yeah. What did Susan do?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm afraid I can't say, sir. Do not expect her to return within at least the next forty eight hours.\"</p>\n<p>He woke up.</p>\n<p>\"What the hell do you mean by that? She would never agree to do another fucking mission!\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir, remain calm.\"</p>\n<p>Ted felt his teeth grind, \"Remain calm? You're telling me you arrested my wife! She's a fucking patriot! Do you even understand how she has saved your life? What she gave up for you and every other ungrateful asshole in this country?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir, I am simply passing on a message.\"</p>\n<p>Ted hung up in frustration, and his face went white as another sound accompanied the clang of the phone.</p>\n<p>He sprinted upstairs towards his newborn daughter as she cried.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The man didn't seem comfortable in the suit. He almost seemed too big for it. It was a side affect on perception caused by his enormous stature. He would usually capitilise on it to increase the speed of work down in his branch of ASIO, but today was not that day.</p>\n<p>Rather, he was faced with the task, the incredibly arduous task, of encouragement.</p>\n<p>Something he wasn't much good at, because he would accidentally scare people, even with a reassuring hand.</p>\n<p>The Head of the Australian Signals Directorate smiled a broad tooth smile, trying to be encouraging, but probably imitating a shark instead. \"We have a heck of a task ahead of us today... You see, today, we'll be trying to begin our review of the CSIS crisis, and how we could set up protocols in our own nation to prevent them from occurring again.\"</p>\n<p>The room fell deathly silent, and he wasn't sure if it was his smile, the way he phrased it, or the task in and of itself.</p>\n<p>A rogue ASIO agent had executed a series of terrorist strikes against Canada, including wiping out a quarter of their intelligence agency, because he no longer believed in freedom. The man had had enough, and so he attempted to destroy relations between the two countries, and truth be told - it was working.</p>\n<p>At length he sighed and opened the folder in front of him, \"Right. Moving on, the first issue is access. We still are not sure how John O'Connor managed to gain access to Canada. It was not on a civilian passport. Being the former head of Operations, he may have utilised flaws in our system, or had old unused passports from previous operations.\"</p>\n<p>One of the men at the table winced, \"There's still too much conjecture about how this was done. I don't think we can make an accurate, or even umbrella, protocol to deal with this with our current information. There has to be something more.\"</p>\n<p>Another member, thumbing though the brief smiled, \"The agent involved would be a Susan Drakes, yes?\"</p>\n<p>The Head smiled and nodded warmly, \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>The man shrugged, \"Then let's interview her. She was just brought in for questioning. It was in this mornings packet.\"</p>\n<p>Andrew frowned, \"And we'd just be able to get another branch to hand her over?\"</p>\n<p>The man shrugged, \"For a few hours? It's worth a shot.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Anna Doherty was the head of the Joint Terrorism Taskforce, a group within MI5 dedicated to eliminating and preparing for terrorist threats.</p>\n<p>The Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the utter crap that had been caused by an ex-ASIO agent had finally made it to the top of her in pile.</p>\n<p>She looked the document over, ignoring the fact that three words in five were redacted, and paused as she reached the end.</p>\n<p>She had been attempting to ignore use of conjecture, and any other ballsy move that might have her leap to the wrong conclusion, but this fact was solid.</p>\n<p>She picked up her phone, \"Get someone from Human Resources in here, now.\"</p>\n<p>She glared at the last line again.</p>\n<p>Susan Drakes had retired.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Isaac Jacques stood up slowly from the end of the table, and begun to circle the room. As he passed by each member of the investigative group, he could see them shiver out of the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>He smiled.</p>\n<p>\"Gentleman, we have suffered greatly. Not only did we watch in horror as our nation was attacked, by a trained member of an allied nation, no less! Not only that, we were forced to pour over the facts. We have seen atrocities, spoke with so many friends who lost their own. We have been forced to witness the very worst of mankind. And now, we lie at a time when a decision must be made, or we may as well set ourselves adrift.\" </p>\n<p>He paused, letting it sink in, letting the fresh memories of horror rise to the surface again. \"ASIO fudged it. They had a man, a good man, and turned him into a weapon against us. For no reason, no good reason, they failed to keep their own under wraps. Instead, we have another ASIO agent, with a history of violence, and a weakness to her age, sent here to repair the damage. She stops the man, but in the process we have lost the best of our own agency.\"</p>\n<p>He came back to his seat, and leaned on the head, \"Friends, now is the time for justice. ASIO must be punished for their inequities, and Drakes must be extradited for her failure to control the situation. We have no alternative.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The newsreader smiled warmly at the camera, \"And now we're going live to Canada, where a spokesman for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service says that they have finished their investigation into the terrorist attacks that killed and maimed so many.\"</p>\n<p>The camera cuts quickly, to a smiling man in a suit who speaks just a second too slowly, telling of the time difference. \"Yes, thankyou, Kat. We have finished our investigation, and the results are pretty much what you can expect. We have maintained throughout the investigation our certainty that Australia failed to act in the right manner, and we believe that is the case.\" He continues on ignoring the reporter attempting to ask a question, \"The Australian agent who ended the terrorist's life acted in a way that put the public in danger, and the terrorist himself used to be a member of ASIO. If you can't trust your own friends, who can you trust?\"</p>\n<p>The reporter looked a bit more concerned than she should have, \"What action is the Canadian government actually undertaking?\"</p>\n<p>\"We've already established new procedures and protocols to protect our nation, but we really don't think this will be over until we have interrogated the agent we blame for so much loss.\"</p>\n<p>The reporter was stunned, \"Does Canada intend to request Australia to hand over the agent who saved so many lives?\"</p>\n<p>The man sighed heavily, anger appearing on his face, \"She didn't. Even if we hadn't responded to the crisis in twice the time it took us, if she hadn't been involved, nearly seventy percent of those involved would not have died. She intervened in a sovereign nation, and nearly killed us all. She needs to pay for her crimes.\" He sighed heavily, whistling in the microphone, \"We believe the Australian government will agree with us.\"</p>\n",
