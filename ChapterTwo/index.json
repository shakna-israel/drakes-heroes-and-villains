You were one of our best. Leaving\u2026 When you did\u2026 You triggered a witch hunt, and set yourself up as the target\u2026 Why?\"</p>\n<p>Her jaw set, and she glared at him, \"Every person I have cared about during my line of work\u2026 In anyway\u2026 I have had to kill. I have had friends and colleagues die, that's hard enough. But I saw the face of the man who trained me, protected me, and saved my ass when I was kidnapped. I saw his face when I had to kill him. That's not something anyone can ever take back.\"</p>\n<p>McKenzie winced, and then nodded slowly, \"I'm sorry about that\u2026 All of this. I'd protect you if I could\u2026 But it took a bit of effort to make ASIO hand you over in the short term. I don't think I can twist their arm any more.\"</p>\n<p>She laughed, smiling at him, revealing a piece of that girl who had laughed and run for so long, \"Dude, you've done enough. I saw what you did. You've done well\u2026 But man\u2026 It took me four hours into an interrogation to ID you. That's just sad. You kind of stand out in a crowd.\"</p>\n<p>The man in the suit smiled sadly, \"Losing you is still a loss. Especially if the world has its way and you get torn to pieces\u2026 You are brilliant, Drakes. Purely. You think faster than most people can grasp. You have been out of the game for years\u2026 And you can still piece together who I am. And my rank. Even though I wasn't in this position when you left. I'm part of a group of people who you never had to talk to before. The amount of information in your head is slightly scary.\"</p>\n<p>She smiled sadly and shrugged, \"To be honest\u2026 I wish it wasn't there. I\u2026 I'd give just about anything to be normal. To have my husband look at me, and not feel stupid. To not be afraid that my daughter will be like me\u2026 I became what I am, because I had to. My arm never healed. It should have, but it didn't. So I became better, so I could fix myself. I\u2026 I'm just a product of my environment. Seriously\u2026 I feel like the world hates me half the time.\"</p>\n<p>McKenzie nodded slowly, empathetic sadness reflected in his brown eyes, \"Drakes\u2026 No one could ever blame you. You were a teenager, and you were turned into a bodyguard. Someone who puts their life on the line, day after day, after day. Never given a chance to consider if their own life is more valuable than what they are protecting. And you are. You are worth a thousand times more than anybody you ever protected. I can't imagine the good you could have done if ASIO hadn't picked you up\u2026 But a hospital had. Your life\u2026 Is worth more than I can describe. I just\u2026 You're getting a raw deal. I wish you could be protected, but someone is gunning for you.\"</p>\n<p>She smiled, \"I know.\"</p>\n<p>Then the expression on her face changed, and her jaw became ever so slightly firmer. McKenzie recognised the look and leapt backwards as she pushed herself to her feet.</p>\n<p>Drakes scratched the side of her face and looked at the man like he was an enemy, \"My house was just breached. Was it you, or the ASD?\"</p>\n<p>McKenzie swallowed, \"No.\"</p>\n<p>She smiled bitterly, \"No idea whether to believe you or not. You are far too likeable\u2026 Get the fuck out of my way, and I won't kill you.\"</p>\n<p>She walked towards the door as it was flung open, a guard lowering a taser towards her, but as he fired the two small prongs hit a prepared metal arm, gearing whirring inside, and the taser was ripped from the man's grasp, and she caught it and crushed it.</p>\n<p>She didn't pause to fight the guard as she walked out of the room, her foot flicking his out from under him, and a viscous elbow crushing the man's throat.</p>\n<p>Drakes kept walking, war written on her face as alarms began to blare.</p>\n<p>She didn't care.</p>\n<p>Someone had breached her home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>His head was pulsing, and he knew that he was still sitting from the way it was hanging.</p>\n<p>That\u2026 That really hurt.</p>\n<p>Why did he have a headache?</p>\n<p>And why the hell couldn't he see?</p>\n<p>He tried to rub his head and winced as his hands refused to move, just a jangle of metal.</p>\n<p>His eyes widened, and he groaned, \"Damn. Damn. Damn. You have got to be kidding me.\"</p>\n<p>Then an electrifying thought shot through him.</p>\n<p>Arlia.</p>\n<p>Where was his daughter?</p>\n<p>There was a yank on his head, and he was bathed in light. He blinked, trying to blearily see through the fog of his own eyes, and he could vageuly make out a man wearing a black leather mask standing close to him.</p>\n<p>He was holding two things, one small, one large.</p>\n<p>Ted blinked furiously, trying to see, and for a fleeting movement he had a clear image. A masked man holding his daughter and a knife.</p>\n<p>Ted winced, trying to see, \"What do you want?\"</p>\n<p>The masked man laughed softly, \"Come now, I'm sure the husband to Susan Drakes could work that one out.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not her.\" He said firmly, and the man threw back his head, laughing. </p>\n<p>The knife danced dangerously close to his daughter and Ted felt his voice catch in his throat, and then the man shrugged, nonchalantly waving the knife around as he did. \"We don't want anything from you. Or your wife, in fact. If you don't try anything, Ted Jameson, then you and you daughter will be handed back to your police. Not a scratch on either of you\u2026 Except for the bump on your head, I mean. I have no intention to harm any of you.\"</p>\n<p>Ted stared at him, \"Leverage? You're going to use me, and my daughter\u2026 To make Susan do something?\"</p>\n<p>The masked man nodded, \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Ted burst out laughing, he couldn't help it.</p>\n<p>The man gripped the knife tighter, \"Is there something comical about a man with a knife, and your daughter?\"</p>\n<p>\"You're going to fucking die!\" Ted laughed, and shook his head, \"And any scratch you put on either of us\u2026 Will replicated a hundred\u2026 A thousand-fold on yourself!\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Andrew McKenzie was standing in the lobby, horror written on his face. Something that he doubted would change anytime in the next few months.</p>\n<p>It was carnage.</p>\n<p>Guards with broken limbs, others with worse injuries.</p>\n<p>Several lay dead, their necks broken or their skulls caved in.</p>\n<p>He had asked them to stop her\u2026 To contain her\u2026 And she had ripped them apart.</p>\n<p>Alone.</p>\n<p>He pulled his mobile from his pocket and dialled a number, a tired sounding voice answered, \"Yes? What is it, McKenzie?\"</p>\n<p>\"Susan Drakes is no longer in my custody.\"</p>\n<p>\"What the fuck!?\" Came the shouted reply, crackling down the line, and Andrew winced, \"Currently I'd estimate that we have six dead, and twenty eight wounded. Something happened at her home.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh shit. Mother-fucking-pile-of-shitting-shitter!\" The voice yelled angrily, and then the man regained his composure, \"I'll deploy a team to bring her in. You get your people in shape. Also, issue a police bulletin. No one is to come within a hundred feet of her. She is armed and dangerous. Call in all sightings.\"</p>\n<p>The man hung up before Andrew could reply, but he could hardly blame the man.</p>\n<p>Last time someone of Susan's calibre had lost it\u2026 A nuclear device had nearly been detonated.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\"Hello, Anna Doherty, Joint Terrorism Analysis.\" She said as she picked up the phone, and her face went white as the voice on the other end spoke.</p>\n<p>\"You have got to be kidding me!\" She growled, \"We were bringing her in. She can help us!\"</p>\n<p>The caller hung up.</p>\n<p>Anna put her head in her hands and yelled angrily.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it was the only thing she could do. She might be the head of the JTA\u2026 But they were still simply a department within MI5, and when orders came from that high up, and were authenticated\u2026 There was no point arguing.</p>\n<p>She sighed and logged into the database, and typed a quick command, barely hesitating before hitting the return key.</p>\n<p>As far as Joint Terrorism Analysis was concerned, Susan Drakes had never existed.</p>\n<p>Even her own investigation was to be expunged.</p>\n<p>Susan Drakes was persona non grata.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Samuel Nikolai paced in front of the heavily armed group, an eight man team. Each with specialties, and expertise in a wide range of weapons and tactics.</p>\n<p>They were a retrieval team, one of the best that he had at his disposal.</p>\n<p>Which was saying something.</p>\n<p>He smiled softly, \"MI5 has removed all official records of the target. You are to capture her, alive, and return her here for interrogation. If, for some reason, she is not going to survive, don't attempt to acquire any information. Destroy everyone in sight.\"</p>\n<p>The captain of the team barely shifted from his rigid stance, standing at attention, and Samuel glared, \"Something to say, grunt?\"</p>\n<p>The man winced at the insult, \"No sir.\"</p>\n<p>Samuel laughed, \"Come now, out with it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Susan Drakes is not worth this, sir.\" The man stated briskly, and Samuel blinked, \"Really? Arguably the smartest woman in the world, about to get her ass handed to her by the Canadians, a woman who single-handedly prevented an atomic detonation, and who is the inventor of modern exoskeleton construction, is not worth snatching?\"</p>\n<p>The captain frowned, \"She was a subpar agent, sir. The issue should have been dealt with by those in the know.\"</p>\n<p>Samuel stepped in front of the captain, glaring at him, eye to eye, \"Susan Drakes is the only reason that a nuclear device was not detonated on Canadian soil. The only reason that the USA was not blamed. There is no finer agent, captain. She was kidnapped, but defeated the man who seized her and her technology, almost by herself, when she was still at high school. For god's sake, the woman is only twenty one years old!\"</p>\n<p>He stepped back and shook his head, \"Do not underestimate that woman, captain. She has survived assassination attempts, terrorist attacks, and major damage to her body. All the while\u2026 Her mind has been active. That woman, the one you are tasked with bringing in to me\u2026 Is the smartest person you will ever meet.\"</p>\n",
