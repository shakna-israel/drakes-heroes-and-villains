              <h1 id="chapter-eight">Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>Suzie groaned, opening her swollen eyelids slowly, her eyes flicking around the room.</p>
<p>She was alone.</p>
<p>She sat up slowly, trying to listen, but there was no other breathing in the room.</p>
<p>She grinned and grabbed the chair with both ankles, and backflipped, shattering it on the ground, with a not inconsiderable amount of pain. She pushed herself upright, ignoring the pain from her limp arm as she ran over to the equipment that had been used to torture her.</p>
<p>Suzie attached one crocodile clip to the door frame to her cell, and the other to the handle.</p>
<p>Then she turned to assess her situation.</p>
<p>She didn't have either her arm nor ankle exoskeletons, which meant she was slow and weak. The only tech ology left in her cell was a couple car batteries, a screwdriver, and some power cables.</p>
<p>She sighed and knelt next to one of the spare batteries, using the screwdriver to remove the lid carefully. It was an enclosed system, designed as a non-evaporative housing.</p>
<p>Inside she found a couple of measuring levels, and the acid.</p>
<p>Not a lot of use there.</p>
<p>If they'd left a blowtorch she could make a bomb with a little effort, but as it was, all she had was electricity and cables.</p>
<p>She slapped herself in the forehead, and resealed the battery, and grabbed a nearby jumper cable and tore the rubber off with the screwdriver.</p>
<p>She then began twisting the wire into a dozen new forms.</p>
<p>Someone collapsed in the hallway with a thud, and some screaming.</p>
<p>She winced and sped up her work, as voices began shouting.</p>
<p>Suzie stood up slowly, the wire wrapped around her body with precious little insulation, but if her math was right, she probably wouldn't die.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>She felt the weight of the two batteries at her back, and tensed the fist on the arm that worked, the other was held in place that she could block with it.</p>
<p>Suzie smiled and detached her trap from the door, and then kicked it open into the face of the man on the other side.</p>
<p>Before he could react she'd punched him in the chest and stopped his heart.</p>
<p>She turned and sprinted towards the two men attempting to draw their guns, grabbing one around the neck as she kicked the other, feeling the hair on her body scorching from the close contact with that much power arcing through the air.</p>
<p>Both dropped dead.</p>
<p>Suzie glanced around, spotting another cell, and she ran over, picking the lock with a spare piece of wire pointing out from her wrist, and she tossed it open.</p>
<p>She stopped.</p>
<p>Everything in her stopped.</p>
<p>A man lay in a chair, head twisted to the side, blood stains around a gaping whole in his forehead, a splatter of brain and blood behind him.</p>
<p>She was too late.</p>
<p>... Ted was gone.</p>
<p>Suzie tried to fight the emotion she was feeling, she was still in danger. Arlia was still missing.</p>
<p>But... Her lip trembled, vibrating crazily as she fought back the tears, trying to control her breathing, staying in the moment.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Jameson." A muffled voice spoke behind her, and she turned around slowly, looking at the masked man standing there, with a gun pointed at a sleeping baby in the cradle of his arm.</p>
<p>She felt the rage burn through her, engulfing everything, "You bastard."</p>
<hr />
<p>Alison swore, ducking back as a piece of wall the size of her fist vanished.</p>
<p>Sniper fire was everything she feared.</p>
<p>The MI5 unit had begun firing as they were still getting into position, and Alison had taken a knife to the knee almost immediately - she still had no idea who had thrown it.</p>
<p>She checked her rifle, fixed her breathing and spun around, sighting and squeezing off three rounds before ducking down again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kaley gasped as pieces of her midsection vanished. She collapsed forwards onto the ground, blood seemingly pouring from her like water from a tap.</p>
<p>She winced, forcing her hands to move as she triggered one of Dunstan's traps.</p>
<hr />
<p>Frank ducked as an explosion made the room to his left vanish in smoke and flame, but the gun mounted to the floor in front of him never stopped turning, as he spun it, making a wall disappear under a hail of heavy fire.</p>
<p>Then he danced backwards in shock and pain, blinking ad he realized most of his right hand bad vanished into a bloody pulp.</p>
<hr />
<p>Andrew slid another bullet into the chamber and resighted, ignoring the heavy gunner - he was down for now.</p>
<p>His primary concerns were the three figures on the rooftop. One sniper, a spotter who seemed to be covered in knives, and someone carrying handguns - but who seemed to have an incredible amount of accuracy with them.</p>
<p>He fired off two shots, slid back down, and began moving to his next contact point.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dunstan's head jerked up as he saw Sam hit the ground, coughing, but she was still alive.</p>
<p>He flicked his fingers across his console, setting timers on half a dozen explosives, "Captain, how are they this good?"</p>
<p>The sniper just smiled, "We used to train under them, not with them, Dunst. This four man team is more than a match for us. Blow the bottom floor."</p>
<hr />
<p>Sam thanked whatever deity was listening for the invention of body armor, and sat up, pulling the binoculars to her eyes, "Sniper is moving, Captain. Probably six yards right."</p>
<p>Captain J spoke steadily, "I have him... Wind speed?"</p>
<p>She flicked around, spotting something moving, "Twenty six knots."</p>
<p>Captain J adjusted slowly, "Distance to target?"</p>
<p>She frowned, "Two hundred and forty yards."</p>
<p>J fired twice, and began pushing new shells in, "Damn. I think I missed."</p>
