The station she was coming up to was an open-planned space, with a lot of people in it.</p>\n<p>Easy to drop someone with a knife to the back.</p>\n<p>Easy to kill a lot of bystanders.</p>\n<p>A wince went across her face as she finished the modifications to her arm's exoskeleton and snapped the cover shut. She had a really bad feeling about this.</p>\n<p>Suzie tapped her ear, \"Broly.\"</p>\n<p>I read you, Mistress Drakes.</p>\n<p>She swallowed nervously, thinking about whether that was a good thing.</p>\n<p>Broly Core was one of her pet projects after leaving ASIO, an open-source learning Artificial Intelligence which had in-built rules it could never break, but could expand based on its own knowledge. An AI that would protect the world from itself.</p>\n<p>ASIO had shut it down as soon as other people had started taking notice of it, and that was probably a good thing.</p>\n<p>\u2026 This situation had changed things.</p>\n<p>So Suzie had reactivated it, and built up a little\u2026 But it was still untested.</p>\n<p>The train began to shudder as it slowed down, and she breathed in deeply and stood up, grabbing on of the leather hand-grips hanging from the roof.</p>\n<p>As the train pulled in she flicked the MyKi card from her hoodie, not for the first time wondering why the Australian government had chosen an unproven and outdated system, using RFID, over something powerful and proven like NFC-based cards, such as the one used in Singapore.</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes, government officials rarely knew a damn thing about technology - why she had been given so much freedom with ASIO, and so little after she had left.</p>\n<p>The train finished its descent and she tapped the MyKi card to the reader, waiting for it to finally let her off.</p>\n<p>She stepped off and swallowed nervously as her feet met the platform.</p>\n<p>Then she went deaf.</p>\n<p>Suzie dove to the side as the concrete turned into something a little less dense. She rolled over and stood up, pistol appearing in her hand, and her eyes flickered from terrified face to terrified face.</p>\n<p>She swore and flipped herself into the air, grabbing the top of a bench and sliding under it.</p>\n<p>She couldn't see whoever was trying to kill her.</p>\n<p>Suzie breathed in deeply, \"Broly, you in the security feeds yet?\"</p>\n<p>Two targets. One on the above platform, centre, not hiding. The other approaching your location, twenty feet and closing. Both armed with a new unknown model of machine gun.</p>\n<p>Suzie winced, and leaped to her feet, spinning to see the man approaching through the crowd, and she ducked into a crouch, raising her arm as a metallic disc expanded from it, immediately denting as a dozen bullets slammed into it.</p>\n<p>She clenched her fist and flexed, the shield spun apart into shards and launched themselves forward.</p>\n<p>Several screamed as the shards slammed into them, and Suzie fired her pistol, the man's head snapped backwards and he collapsed to the ground.</p>\n<p>Pain shot through her, and she fell forwards to her knees, swearing at herself.</p>\n<p>She glared up and fired a dozen times, causing the other gunmen to duck out of sight, as she sprinted forward under his hiding spot.</p>\n<p>No way to shoot her down here.</p>\n<p>The opposite was true of herself however.</p>\n<p>They had taken her daughter.</p>\n<p>She tossed a small disc upwards and it latched into the concrete, and then exploded.</p>\n<p>Suzie ducked backwards, falling over as she hit the wall. She winced and touched her stomach where she had been shot and cursed again, \"Broly\u2026 How long do I have to live?\"</p>\n<p>The wound does not appear to be fatal, however, you will lose consciousness in forty eight seconds. If you do not receive medical attention within two hours or so, you may then die.</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled softly as black flecks started to fill her vision, \"Wonderful. This sucks.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ted looked at the masked man through bleary eyes, \"What did you do with my wife?\"</p>\n<p>The man shrugged, \"I have not the slightest idea. That was not my concern. I was only concerned with your capture, your daughter's capture, and encouraging your wife to arrive at Flinders Street Station. Nothing more.\"</p>\n<p>Ted winced, \"So what now, I go free? You let my daughter get to the hospital, after what you did?\"</p>\n<p>The masked man sighed heavily, \"You truly are a dreamer, Ted Jameson. I am afraid\u2026 Well, you should have guessed it by now.\"</p>\n<p>Ted swallowed, trying to ignore his fear, knowing that there was no way out of this.</p>\n<p>He felt himself silently begging for his wife to come crashing through the door, to tear the head off this madman, and kill them all.</p>\n<p>Instead, he was looking down the barrel of a gun.</p>\n<p>God help -</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Andrew paused, looking at the blood stains against the wall and floor, and crouched.</p>\n<p>He felt the three females who made up his unit tense behind him, and he swallowed cautiously, \"Drakes took a beating\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Alice spoke with pain, \"Nobody deserves to be hit like this\u2026 What kind of gun did they even use?\"</p>\n<p>\"Something new.\" Andrew said shrugging, touching one of the shells with his foot, \"About .50 calibre\u2026 But fired from a gun that was way too small. Probably some sort of magnetic propulsion.\"</p>\n<p>Sheila sighed heavily, \"She was our target, wasn't she?\"</p>\n<p>Andrew stood and looked over to the last member of his team, \"Alison, call it in.\"</p>\n<p>She flipped open a phone, \"Macedon, we found a trace of Drakes.\" She pressed a button and the phone switched to speaker mode.</p>\n<p>\"A trace? Why are you calling?\"</p>\n<p>Andrew winced, \"She was attacked by two armed gunmen, and then six or seven others turned up and took off with her. They used advanced weaponry, or at least something we haven't seen before.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wait\u2026 What? Someone else is after our girl? What the hell is going on?\"</p>\n<p>Andrew sighed, \"I think someone forced Drakes' hand. She acted out because of a threat.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh\u2026 Shoot\u2026 People are going to die, aren't they?\"</p>\n<p>\"Drakes killed seven bystanders, sir.\" Sheila spoke firmly, and Macedon swore loudly, and then sighed, \"Fine. Go get her, and make sure she stays alive. Try not to get yourself or any more people killed. If Drakes is facing a threat\u2026 Use your own judgement. Got that, Captain McKenzie?\"</p>\n<p>Andrew rubbed his face, \"Yes, sir.\"</p>\n<p>The phone beeped and Alison shut it, \"So\u2026 What's the plan?\"</p>\n<p>Andrew smiled tightly, \"We kill whoever tried to kill Drakes. Then we get her to come up with a better plan.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Samuel Nikolai looked across the table at the man sitting there comfortably, reading the few scraps of paper. At length the man lay them down and glared at him, \"MI5 are retrieving Drakes. Yes?\"</p>\n<p>Nikolai frowned, \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>The man scratched his chin, \"Without Australia's permission.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>The man smiled softly, \"You have balls, Nikolai\u2026 But as for Canada\u2026 We want access to her\u2026 Once you're done, of course.\"</p>\n<p>Nikolai blinked, \"CSIS wants access to Susan Drakes? Why? So they can publicly execute her?\"</p>\n<p>\"We don't do that.\" The man said and smiled, \"She is a valuable source of information. Very smart, very powerful, and has done some pretty incredible things by herself.\"</p>\n<p>Nikolai sighed and tapped the pieces of paper, \"Well\u2026 MI5 would like some information.\"</p>\n<p>\"Full access to our database on it. In exchange for her.\"</p>\n<p>Nikolai cocked his head, \"How much access? Really?\"</p>\n<p>\"Full.\" The man reiterated and shrugged, \"12 months worth. A lot your people could do with that.\"</p>\n<p>Nikolai smiled and held out his hand, \"Deal.\"</p>\n",
