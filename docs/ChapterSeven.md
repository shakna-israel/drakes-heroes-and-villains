# Chapter Seven

"Holy mother fucking piece of shit!" Suzie screamed in pain, staring in surprise at the man holding the two crocodile clips connected to a car battery.

"Dude… Are you trying to kill me? At least have an alternator in that thing." She glared, but the man didn't respond.

He didn't ask any questions.

He just shocked her again.

And again.

She screamed in pain, feeling bones fracture as her muscles tensed around them, and flexed… But no one asked her questions.

Not a one.

Sheila frowned and spoke into the small microphone attached to her throat, "Eh… Boss?"

"What is it, Shiela?" Andrew's voice came back from inside, and she winced, "We have snipers watching us. If I recognise the uniforms… They're MI5."

"Aw shit. Really? Whelp… I guess it's time to take them out."

She smiled, "What's the plan, boss?"

"Captain J?" The voice came, and he winced, "Mr. Nikolai, what I can do for you?"

"You're watching the ASIO unit, correct?"

"Yes, sir." He answered, looking through his scope, "They're still investigating the scene. The only survivor has been escorted off, but only the ASIO units have remained. They told the cops to piss off.

"Good. Eliminate them. With high prejudice. Get any data they collected, and push it our way."

He blinked, "Say what?"

"Kill the fucking ASIO agents!" Nikolai yelled, and Captain J winced, "Yes, sir."
