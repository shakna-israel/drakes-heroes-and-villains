# Chapter Ten

Captain J glanced down his scope, searching the windows for a target.

He had no spotter this time around, and had to make a few judgement calls as his unit and CSIS converged on the building.

He saw a rifle reposition slightly from the rooftop, and he fired quickly, the gunner going slack and collapsing to the floor.

"We're a go." He whispered into his mike, and he saw rapid bursts on gunfire light up the building.

This was going to be hell.

Suzie's head snapped up with the gunfire and Isaac spun towards the door, "What in the hell?"

She grinned and grabbed his neck, breaking it. Isaac slumped forwards onto the ground with a thud.

She flexed the fingers on her exoskeleton and glanced back down at the machine she was building.

A weapon designed to eliminate so many people.

A weapon of convenience, the weapon of a terrorist.

Suzie smiled and began to rewire it.

---

Sam ducked back behind the stone corner, the CSIS agent beside her wasn't so lucky, and collapsed to the ground in a spray of blood.

This was insane.

Utter hell.

The militants had taken out just about everyone.

Was she the last left?

Another spray of gunfire down the hall, not directed at her, told her otherwise.

She spun into the open, weapon at the ready and froze as she saw her captain. He nodded and turned, and she ran over, falling in behind him.

"Sir..."

He shook his head, "Lets just get through this. The weapons they've been using are better than ours. Fires faster, uses bigger rounds and has a huge clip on them. Grab one. You'll need it."

The two crept down the hall and Captain J kicked in a door, pointing his weapon.

A dead man lay on the floor, and Drakes was working franticly, sweat pouring off her forehead.

Captain J tightened his grip on his gun, but the woman didn't even glance at him, "Killing me isn't going to be overly helpful here... Who are you, anyway?"

Sam felt her throat tense at the emotionless and casual way the woman spoke, and her Captain glared, "MI5, with orders to kill you."

Suzie shrugged, continuing to work, "Well, that's sort of pointless. You need to run. In about two minutes, everybody in this room is going to be very dead. This... Well... Think of it as a bomb without an explosion. It'll stop the hearts of everyone within twenty meters of the outside of this building, if my math is right."

Sam looked at the woman in astonishment, "Why the hell would you build that?"

"They killed my husband. Threatened to kill my daughter. I didn't have a lot of choice... But now? I get to use it on them." She growled, and Sam frowned, "But your daughter..."

"Died the moment there was gunfire." Drakes said without hesitation, wiping sweat from her forehead with her shoulder, "Now please... Run. Enough people have died because of me."

Captain J nodded and turned, "Time to move, Sam."

The masked man adjusted a tie as he stepped calmly from the back of the building, opening the door of his car and slid in.

He started the engine and then a flicker of fear crossed his serene face.

His left side had gone numb, and it was intensely difficult to breathe.

His hand flew to his heart to check his pulse, but it was already too late and he collapsed forwards, no longer breathing.
