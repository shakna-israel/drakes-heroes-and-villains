## Blurb

Three years after [Drakes: The Five Eyes](https://shakna-israel.github.io/drakes-the-five-eyes), a global investigation into the events is underway, and all eyes are on Suzie Drakes.

Some want to see her as the scapegoat, others the victim.

She just wants to be left alone.

But the world isn't that nice.
