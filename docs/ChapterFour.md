# Chapter Four

She was in a restaurant, hiding in a booth.

It wasn't the best of hiding places, especially considering the cliché, but she was having trouble thinking.

The TV suddenly cut from a country-style soap opera to a new bulletin, and her eyes jerked up, glaring as she saw the scrolling banner underneath.

Terrorist threatens Australia, tortures child.

Then a censored video kicked in, a masked man holding a knife, a child screaming under him as blood began to spill. The camera cut to a man screaming in rage, tears pouring from his eyes.

Her heart caught in her throat and tears began to fall unbidden from her eyes, she barely noticed that the restaurant had gone silent.

The volume on the TV increased, and it cut back to the reporter, "Again, we apologise for the shocking footage. Terrorists have threatened the Australian government to hand over ex-agent, Susan Drakes."

Her picture appeared on the screen, beside a still of Arlia screaming, "This is the woman, Susan Drakes. She has served as a bodyguard to some our best politicians, and protected thousands more, in fact she was the sole agent responsible for stopping the nuclear attack in Canada, three years ago. Parliament is yet to issue any statement."

She didn't care.

She couldn't stop the tears.

Couldn't get the picture of Arlia screaming out of her mind, the blood flowing from her baby girl.

The gun pressed into his temple. He really couldn't give a shit. His eyes were red and tired, and anger flowed through every nerve in his body. He felt like he could break his restraints and kill everyone in the room.

Too bad it was only a feeling.

"Time to call her, Mr. Jameson." The man said and sighed, the knife, still slick with blood reappeared, "I am not a patient man. You will call your wife, and do as instructed, or I will kill the child this time."

Ted looked up at him slowly, "You piece of shit."

The masked figure rubbed his forehead slowly, "I do not care for your moral ambiguities. I have a job to do, and I am efficient. Call your wife, or watch your daughter die."

"She'll find you, and tear you to pieces." Ted growled and the man laughed, "We are trying to arrange a meeting with her. I have no wish to fight your wife. It was simply her… Fault."

The phone was put next to his head, and a mechanical voice spoke, "What is the number you would like to call?"

Ted squeezed his eyes shut, trying to recall, "00, 61, 450, 187, 123, 481, 972."

"Dialling."

Then the call connected, and a shallow breathing was all he heard, "Suzie?"

There was nothing for a short while, but then a broken and cracked voice spoke haggardly, "Ted?"

"It's me. There's some people here who want me to tell you something."

"Go ahead." She said, exhaustion and pain echoing in every syllable, and Ted glanced at a written message that was held up, "They want to meet at Flinders Street Station, Melbourne. Two o'clock, 1400, at Platform One."

"I'll be there… Ted… Stay alive."

Then she hung up.

Ted swallowed, "She'll be there."

The masked man nodded, "Good…"

Matthew Macedon looked at the four agents in front of him, their pistols holstered, and he nodded grimly, "Your priority is silence. Be swift, and don't catch anybody's attention. But you have to succeed."

The crew nodded silently, and he cracked his knuckles nervously, "Your target is Susan Drakes. Contain, capture and transport. Get her here, so I can talk to her. If she won't come, make it so she can't argue."

"Yes sir!"

Captain J stepped off the train at Southern Cross Station, and he sniffed the air, "Almost like home."
