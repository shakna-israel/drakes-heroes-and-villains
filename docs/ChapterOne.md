# Chapter One

Drakes looked at the man putting her cuffs on with contempt, "You know these can't hold me, right?"

The agent winced, "They have a device inside that shocks the hell out of you if you break them."

Drakes grinned, "I know that. That's kinda why they won't work."

The agent ignored the gleam in her eyes and stood back, "Look, you aren't in a position to be a bitch. CSIS just publicly blamed you for what went wrong in Canada, and they want us to hand you over to them. The Signals guys just want some help, so help 'em out. You have no friends here anymore, girl."

Drakes rolled her eyes and opened her palm, displaying the keys to the cuffs, "Fine. Take them back. Just because you are being nice, and I don't want you to get fired."

The agent shook his head as he took them, "Why did someone like you quit, anyway?"

Her face went dark, "How many friends have you had to kill, in your job?"

He winced, "Yeah, I guess."

She shrugged as he loaded her into the van, "I was happier out there. In here... I'm just the girl who murdered the guy who trained her. Like you said, I've got no friends here."

Ted rocked the cradle gently with a foot as he leaned over the bed, quickly tossing clothes into a bag, packing it tightly. He should have had it packed, and if she was here, Susan would have berated the hell out of him. But she wasn't, and it was the reason he was packing.

After she'd left, Susan had prepared escape plans and contingency plans. She'd made him memorize all of them. With ASIO as a disgruntled employer, anything could happen.

And now... She wasn't coming home.

It was time to disappear, at least for a short while.

He zipped the bag shut and turned around to pick up his daughter, but the world swam sideways and he felt the floor rise up and hit him in the face.

His last thought before shadow took him was, "I should have kept the bag packed."

She yawned as her cuffs were connected to a steel bench, and a man sat down opposite her. "Miss Drakes, how was your trip?"

She laughed, "People are pissed off with me. What do you think?"

The man, an unusually tall figure, smiled softly, nervousness surrounding his whole figure, "Sorry about that. We'll try and keep this short, and maybe it will help you out. We're just trying to figure a protocol for if what happened in Canada, happened here."

She paused, looking him over carefully, "I'm about sick of dealing with everyone. I left because I couldn't handle it anymore. I'm a broken agent, nothing I give you will be of any use."

He shrugged, "I doubt that. You might be done with the field, but operating on creating protocols? Its hypothetical and distant. That's all we want."

She sighed and ripped her mechanical arm free of the table, rubbing her forehead with it, "I don't know if it can be prevented, to be honest. There is a hell of a lot of intelligence behind the attacks I prevented. First major attack I stopped... The guy was theoretically smart. He understood the way the environment worked, and so he could create crazy powerful weapons. He also had charisma going for him. The second attack... It was someone who had years of field experience. He personally trained me, and so could predict me. He knew my weaknesses and strengths. He knew just about anyone he could send against us. How do you defend against your own boss?"

The man smiled softly, "It can be done, but it is difficult... But lets forget a preventative protocol. Lets say your boss turned against us, and you called it in. How would you want us to handle it?"

She blinked and frowned, drumming her free hand on the table, "I think... I think time would be most important. People like that can do an enormous amount of damage in a really short space of time."

The man nodded, "So... What would we do?"

Drakes shrugged, "Retask satellites, contact agents in the field and set up a live conference. Get everyone in the field coordinated against the individual. Then bring the stations up to speed and get a manhunt out. Only once that is done, try and contact the individual and see if they had any reason for their insane actions. If there's some sort of blame game, shut down both sides and send someone new after the time critical target. It's the only safe way."

The man frowned, watching her carefully, "And if that means an attack is successful?"

She just laughed, "So what? It gives the politicians spin. Let them spin that we need more power or something like that. In the field, that doesn't matter. It doesn't save lives. It might cost them if you don't prepare for a rogue agent. If you take out a good agent thinking they turned, then you lose the ability to effectively command the remaining agents."

The man grinned, "You thought about every possibility, didn't you?"

Drake glared, "No. No I didn't."

He rolled his eyes, "Because no one can think of every situation. I know your intellect, Miss Drakes."

Her teeth ground, "Would everyone stop calling me that? I got married. Least you could do is acknowledge it."

The man paused, "Oh. Sorry, that wasn't in the limited information passed on to me."

She frowned, "Mrs. Jameson. Okay?"

He nodded, "Right then." Then three files appeared on the table, "I'd like you to talk through how you would handle these... Both in field, and as someone back here."

Samuel chortled at her, "What? You want her as some sort of heroine? An idol?"

Anna glared at the man who was, for all intents and purposes, her boss. "What about that do you think is funny? We have a foreign agent, a woman, who saved hundreds, even thousands of lives. Publicly denounced by the people she saved."

The director of MI5 nodded emphatically, "Absolutely. So let's find a fault. Make everyone hate her. We can use that to our advantage."

Anna rolled her eyes, "I think having Drakes in our custody would be far better. Imagine it - one of the smartest women in the world, by our side. She built an exoskeleton warrior suit when she was first kidnapped. She could empower our army, and make our agents faster and stronger."

Samuel scratched his head, "I don't think you get this at all. We don't want anyone associating us with that woman! I don't care how smart she is, she and her former boss, a father figure if he isn't more, caused a god damn international incident."

Anna glared at him, "She could turn JTA into a force as powerful as the Mossad. I want her."
