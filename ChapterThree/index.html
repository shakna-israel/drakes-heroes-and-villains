              <h1 id="chapter-three">Chapter Three</h1>
<p>How dare they? Who would dare to break the sanctity of her home? Who would be fucking stupid enough to pick a  fight with her?</p>
<p>Do not take anyone's family. Take someone's family, and they will not stop until you are dead.</p>
<p>Suzie stepped up behind the police car sitting outside her house, and her hands moved swiftly. The first man collapsed, falling forwards as his neck broke with a sickening snap.</p>
<p>As the other spun around her fist ripped his throat out with a bloody spatter.</p>
<p>She stepped passed them and into her house.</p>
<p>No one touches her family.</p>
<p>Who would be stupid enough to?</p>
<p>Hadn't she given enough? Didn't she suffer enough?</p>
<p>Every night was terror, the nightmares waiting for her to close her eyes. She had given everything! And in return… They tried to take it all again.</p>
<p>She had nearly died a hundred times. Her luck and intellect had barely kept her alive, whilst all around her other people paid the price. How many had to die? How many people had to suffer so that some asshole could get her attention?</p>
<p>She was done with it!</p>
<p>She hated herself far more than she could ever admit, but the rage and darkness that had built within her soul was nothing… Not compared to the rage she found waiting in her heart, this utter blackness that cried out for vengeance. She would strike whoever attempted to leverage her family against her into the grave.</p>
<p>But first, she would make them suffer.</p>
<p>Suzie's eyes widened as she finished the search of the house… Neither Ted nor Arlia were here.</p>
<p>And Ted's packing had been interrupted.</p>
<p>He thought she hadn't noticed… But damn… Her paranoia could have saved him.</p>
<p>Tears welled in her eyes and she pushed her fists to her temples, she wouldn't pay attention to this.</p>
<p>She would get him back.</p>
<p>And Arlia.</p>
<p>She would save her daughter.</p>
<p>Even if it meant that a hundred daughters didn't have their fathers come home.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ted swallowed as masked men began setting up video cameras, one pointed at him, the other at a small steel table.</p>
<p>The man holding his daughter sighed heavily, "I really must apologise, but things have been... Progressing."</p>
<p>Ted swallowed nervously, "What exactly are you going to do?"</p>
<p>The man adjusted his grip on the baby girl, "I am going to place Arlia on that table, and hold her in place with magnetic clamps. I am then going to record both my actions and your reactions."</p>
<p>A red light flicked on near the front of the camera and the masked man made a sound of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Ted felt fear pumping through him, "What are you going to do to my daughter?"</p>
<p>The man sighed, "I apologise. Your wife has made things complicated."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do!?" Ted screamed, horror rising in his gut, twisting tighter.</p>
<p>The man placed Arlia on the table gently, and she immediately started crying from the cold. He placed half rings around her wrist, using an electromagnet to lock them in place.</p>
<p>"Fucking tell me, you bastard!"</p>
<p>Arlia looked up in confusion, her crying suddenly vanishing as the man pulled her limbs taut on the table.</p>
<p>Ted felt tears well in his eyes as he saw a knife appear. "Don't... Please... She's just a baby..."</p>
<p>The man spoke as softly and calmly as always, "I am aware. As I have said... I am sorry for this. But Susan Drakes has made this... Essential."</p>
<hr />
<p>Andrew looked up through the glass as a dozen men burst into his office and began sealing every scrap of paper in sight into a plastic bag. He ground his teeth together angrily and shoved open his office door, "What the hell is this?"</p>
<p>A man standing by himself spun around, "Ah. You would be… Who exactly?"</p>
<p>He glared, "Andrew McKenzie. And this is the Australian Signals Directorate, I think you might be lost."</p>
<p>The man grinned broadly, "Afraid not. My boss's boss just opened an investigation into the ASD. We are here to ensure that all data is controlled, and protected. We may conduct the investigation, but we don't know for sure yet. We're just here to set up for it. You are to terminate all investigations and on-going procedures, and then hand over everything to us."</p>
<p>He glared, feeling his full height, "Warrant."</p>
<p>The man rolled his eyes and produced it, handing it over with a shrug, "I'm sorry man, but these are the kicks."</p>
<p>Andrew scanned the document, noticing the authentic numbers and passphrases, but more he noticed the seal of approval. The issuing agency.</p>
<p>"ASIO is shutting us down?"</p>
<p>The man smiled softly, "Its nothing personal."</p>
<p>"It's about Susan fucking Drakes!" Andrew roared, his whole office turning to stare at their quiet-spoken boss, as he glared down at the ASIO agent, "We had her in our custody, and you are trying to cover up or paint her as a target. Hard to tell, at the moment. She did her job, why can't people just back off?"</p>
<p>The man sighed heavily, "I am Agent Macedon, and this conversation is over. Do as I have said, and then sit down and shut up. We'll talk to you when it suits."</p>
<hr />
<p>Anna paused as the man sat down in front of her.</p>
<p>The man did, his accompanying female officer, did not.</p>
<p>The two police officers wore grim expressions, and the female spoke quietly, just within Anna's peripheral vision, "We are afraid we must ask a favour. Not a nice one."</p>
<p>Anna frowned, "How can I help you, officers? What can the Joint Terrorism Analysis unit do for London's finest?"</p>
<p>The male shook his head, "Not the JTA. You, Anna."</p>
<p>She swallowed nervously, sitting back into her chair, "How can I help?"</p>
<p>The man produced a yellow piece of paper, "We have been investigating certain claims. Those claims have lead us to enough evidence that this warrant was signed. However, we would much prefer…"</p>
<p>The female spoke again, barely in sight, "That you let us in the door, yourself."</p>
<p>Anna blinked, "What? You want to search my flat? What on earth for?"</p>
<p>"There have been complaints made from ranking members of government." The man said and shrugged, "At this stage its unsubstantiated conjecture. We are simply following a lead."</p>
<p>Anna ground her teeth together, "Explain. Stop side-stepping."</p>
<p>The female sighed, "Cash for influence."</p>
<p>Anna glared over at her, "You think I'm corrupt? That someone is paying me to influence policy their way? I do my goddamn job! This is bollocks!"</p>
<p>The man smiled tightly, "And we will find that when we go to your house, if that is the case. We are simply trying to find the facts. We don't need your permission."</p>
<p>Anna sighed heavily, "This is trite. You may as well arrest me now, you are going to one day anyway, on this charge or another."</p>
<p>"Thankyou for your understanding, ma'am." The man said and stood, "Cuff her."</p>
<hr />
<p>Captain J smiled brightly and stepped off the plane, picking up a nearby unloaded case and sprung it open, picking up his machinegun and assembling it with procedural instinct.</p>
<p>A woman punched his shoulder lightly and shrugged on a leather frame filled with knife sheaths. She began inspecting and tucking away each blade, and he smiled softly, "What are you thinking, Sam?"</p>
<p>She laughed, "Retrieving Drakes? This is a dream come true. Time to pit myself against someone who should be able to think faster than I can move."</p>
<p>He turned and inspected his team, each loading, checking and holstering weapons. His eye strayed, as usual, to Huntington, his explosives expert. The man was unwrapping a small metal sphere with extreme caution, and beginning to pull it apart.</p>
<p>"What's in it, Huntington?" He growled and the man flinched, "Don't surprise me, Captain. This is highly unstable."</p>
<p>J tensed his jaw, muscles rippling along it, "Then you shouldn't have brought it."</p>
<p>"It's a seeker. It can track robotics and target it. Blow up when it gets too close. I'm just setting it up for Drakes and her arm. Didn't get a chance before we left." Huntington spoke slowly, concentrating as leveraged a spinning dial with a knife.</p>
<p>Dunstan laughed in the background, "You have some bonkers ideas sometimes, Hunt."</p>
<p>The captain glanced over at his small arms expert, and as expected, he was holstering his fourth pair of pistols to his person, and a lone ninth gun was holstered to the right leg. "Is this a war zone, Dunst?"</p>
<p>The man shrugged, "Nikolai seems to think so, and he seems a good judge of character, most of the time."</p>
<p>He couldn't argue with that, the man had become the head of MI5 based on skill, not blind luck.</p>
<p>Captain J smiled, "We head out in ten, make sure you're ready."</p>
<p>He approached his technical expert, Kaley, as she sat by herself, typing quickly on a small, rugged-looking tablet computer. "So, what do you think?"</p>
<p>"This sucks ass." Kaley muttered, glaring at the screen, "I can't get past the security. It's locked up tighter than anything I've ever seen."</p>
<p>J's face went white, "You can't get us out of this airport?"</p>
<p>She glanced up, "Oh, what? No. That's taken care of. Before we landed. No… Its Drake's home security system. I've never seen an encryption system like this. The encryption procedure is changing every time I take a crack at it."</p>
<p>J winced, "Aw crap. How tight did she lock up her house?"</p>
<p>"Tight. I know its connected to a GPS system of some sort, though. So if I can get in, we can probably find Drakes herself."</p>
<p>He smiled, "You ready to get us out of here, though?"</p>
<p>"It's done. All the staff have been alerted a group of ASIO agents hunting a terrorist are coming through, armed to the hilt. Our photos attached. Once we're out, a worm will eat all the data. It's clean, Captain."</p>
