At least have an alternator in that thing.\" She glared, but the man didn't respond.</p>\n<p>He didn't ask any questions.</p>\n<p>He just shocked her again.</p>\n<p>And again.</p>\n<p>She screamed in pain, feeling bones fracture as her muscles tensed around them, and flexed\u2026 But no one asked her questions.</p>\n<p>Not a one.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Sheila frowned and spoke into the small microphone attached to her throat, \"Eh\u2026 Boss?\"</p>\n<p>\"What is it, Shiela?\" Andrew's voice came back from inside, and she winced, \"We have snipers watching us. If I recognise the uniforms\u2026 They're MI5.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aw shit. Really? Whelp\u2026 I guess it's time to take them out.\"</p>\n<p>She smiled, \"What's the plan, boss?\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\"Captain J?\" The voice came, and he winced, \"Mr. Nikolai, what I can do for you?\"</p>\n<p>\"You're watching the ASIO unit, correct?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir.\" He answered, looking through his scope, \"They're still investigating the scene. The only survivor has been escorted off, but only the ASIO units have remained. They told the cops to piss off.</p>\n<p>\"Good. Eliminate them. With high prejudice. Get any data they collected, and push it our way.\"</p>\n<p>He blinked, \"Say what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Kill the fucking ASIO agents!\" Nikolai yelled, and Captain J winced, \"Yes, sir.\"</p>\n",
