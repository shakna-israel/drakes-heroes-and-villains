Killed my husband... Why would I be reasonable?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because your daughter is not yet dead.\" The man said and shrugged, \"But your ingenuity is precisely the reason you were brought here, and you have shown it. A walking electrical suit of armor. Not a bad play.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed, \"What do you want me to build? For Arlia?\"</p>\n<p>The man nodded slowly, \"You and your daughter will go free. We have already begun creating the device. Look to your right, on the desk.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie glanced over, noticing the bundle of computer chips and wires for the first time. She ran it through her memory,  identifying each piece.</p>\n<p>\"A weapon. It's supposed to... Stop hearts?\" She asked slowly, and the man laughed, \"Yes, indeed. It utilizes sound waves to-\"</p>\n<p>\"Shut up.\" Another man said striding into the room, \"You have no idea how it works. She does.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled, \"This your work?\"</p>\n<p>The new figure nodded, \"Yes. I'm Isaac Ibrahim, you had my boss arrested.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie winced, \"So you used to work for McIntyre... But he would never have allowed you to make something like this. It's the weapon of a terrorist, not a government.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac shrugged, \"Why drop bombs and destroy all the resources when you can simply kill the people inside? So... How does it function, Miss Drakes?\"</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned, \"It negates the brain's own signals, so that if the heart stops, it won't start again. But you haven't found a way to stop the heart yet.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac shook his head, \"I have, I just haven't finished it yet.\" He produced a bundle of chips and lay it on the desk, \"Now... Get out of that thing and turn it off, or Arlia dies.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie switched off the batteries and shrugged the copper wires onto the ground, limping over to the benchtop.</p>\n<p>She glared, \"You're using Pika. My own robotic platform.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac smiled, \"Exactly why we needed you. Pica allows us some predictive analysis and control over the frequencies produced, but we need something more. Coupling Pika and Broly Core together would be preferable.\"</p>\n<p>She winced, \"Then I'll need my arm back. Broly is stored on it, with the legend commands preventing him from running on any other hardware.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac nodded, \"Fair enough.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Captain J picked through the pockets of the ASIO leader, feeling far more depressed than he had expected. His team had taken a real hit from this man and his team, but all the same... They were just doing their jobs.</p>\n<p>The captain pulled an SD card into the open and frowned, he glanced over at Sam and Dunstan, the only other survivors, \"I need Kaley's computer.\"</p>\n<p>Sam winced, \"I'll find it.\"</p>\n<p>Captain J sat up slowly, looking at the man who had damn nearly killed him, and winced, \"A hell of a fight.\"</p>\n<p>The man had managed to shoot the sniper rifle from his hands before Sam had put a knife through his throat.</p>\n<p>Captain J had never felt so certain that he was going to die.</p>\n<p>Sam returned and handed over the wrist computer, except the screen was shattered.</p>\n<p>J shrugged and plugged in the SD card, and then called home.</p>\n<p>\"MI5, Tech Support.\"</p>\n<p>He swallowed, \"This is Captain J. I have a computer from one of my men, badly damaged. It has critical data we just retrieved from the enemy stored on it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just a moment, sir... Can you give me the serial ID on the back of the device?\"</p>\n<p>He frowned and turned it over, seeing a worn number engraved into it, \"Uh... 61718AE9361.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thankyou, the data is downloading... The SD card, right?\"</p>\n<p>J smiled, \"That's right.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir, I've got a red flag here. I'm going to bump you higher, okay?\"</p>\n<p>He winced, \"Yes, that's fine.\"</p>\n<p>A new voice came on the line, \"This is Samuel Adams, Captain J. I specialize in analyzing a terrorist group based out of the Russian region. The data you just sent us... It's from them. I'll need some time to look at it, but they are a group intent on recreating the Soviet Union. They are also very active, and killing means nothing to them. In their last attack they killed over two hundred civilians to get at a single computer chip.</p>\n<p>Captain J nodded, \"Thankyou, stay in contact. We will attempt to track, interrogate and eliminate the group.\"</p>\n<p>\"Understood. Proceed with caution, sir.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The man paused, breathing slowly, and he checked his gun slowly. He tapped his throat mike and whispered a number, and it connected.</p>\n<p>\"This is Captain Phillip, of CSIS, do you read me?\"</p>\n<p>There was a short burst of static, and then a voice spoke in his ear, \"Captain J, MI5. What's going on?\"</p>\n<p>Phil smiled, \"My unit has located the militant hideout where Susan Drakes is being held.\"</p>\n<p>A series of swear words followed, and the man eventually calmed down... Slightly. \"My team was nearly eliminated by ASIO, and CSIS had boots on the ground?\"</p>\n<p>Phil winced, \"I'm very sorry to hear that. Wasn't the intention. Just trying to stay under the radar. Australia hasn't exactly sanctioned any intervention.\"</p>\n<p>Captain J sighed, \"So you found the targets. Now what?\"</p>\n<p>\"If your team is up to it, I'd like to coordinate with you. These are bad people with impressive skills. I'd like MI5 at my back.\" Phil spoke earnestly, watching the building carefully.</p>\n<p>\"We could... But what orders do you have regarding... Drakes?\" J spoke slowly, uncertainly.</p>\n<p>Phil swallowed, \"Not a concern. If she doesn't make it, it is not a concern. Just eliminate the threat that she, and the militants controlling her, are.\"</p>\n<p>Captain J sounded relieved, \"Same here. And to be honest... I think it would be better for everyone... If she... Didn't make it.\"</p>\n<p>Phil breathed out a breath he hadn't realized that he had been holding, \"I agree.\"</p>\n",
