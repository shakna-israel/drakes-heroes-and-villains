<p>The Australian announcement of the events concerning the last acts of Susan Drakes came swiftly, and with retribution. They denounced the actions of England and Canada, acting on their own soil without even alerting them.</p>
<p>They announced the deaths of ASIO agents simply defending their country.</p>
<p>The Five Eyes alliance between the USA, England, Australia, Canada and New Zealand collapsed.</p>
<p>Though Australian ties with the US and New Zealand remained strong, all ties with the others was shattered.</p>
<p>The US joined in denouncing their actions.</p>
<p>The Joint Terrorism Analysis taskforce was officially disbanded.</p>
<p>MI5 opened an internal investigation to find the cause of the event - announcing that the unit acted without the knowledge or approval of their superiors.</p>
<p>The Canadian Security and Intelligence Service was taken apart, piece by piece, and a temporary taskforce was erected to transition the nation as a new intelligence service was built from the ground up, to assure the public that a disaster of this scale would never happen again.</p>
<p>Susan Drakes was officially declared dead, with no public announcement of where she was buried, but she was named as a hero by the Prime Minister of Australia, and a day of mourning was declared.</p>
<p>The two remaining survivors of the incident, unnamed members of MI5 were incarcerated in a secure prison in an unknown location somewhere in Australia.</p>
<p>The leader of the militants was identified as Geoffrey Whitlam, a man leading a terrorist group that splintered from the Soviet Union in the 80s.</p>
<p>Internally, within ASIO, he was identified as a high ranking officer. An investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>... The helplines and police reports continue to come in from members of the public that say that they saw Susan Drakes...</p>
